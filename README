Description:
============

GetIMG works as simple tool when you need to quickly obtain IMG URL.
It is CrossPlatform, modern CrossBrowser compatible.
GetIMG uses jQuery library.
Firstly It searches if the clicked element itself is an IMG.
If not, it continues to search for images of the element's children.
If not, it continues to search for elements image backgrounds.
If nothing is found, GetIMG returns notification it found nothing.


Installation:
-------------

Copy code from "getIMG.min.js" (Mnified source code into one line)
Create new Bookmark in Browser of your choice and put the Javascript code into URL


How to Use:
-----------

After the page is fully loaded, click on your GetIMG bookmark.
Move your cursor then over the Image location (Warning: element recognition doesn't work perfectly, sometimes it is required to make few circles and mouse hover over the image).
To get Image URL, click on the image.
You will get list of images in the popUp window, which can be closed via close ("X") button or automatically closed when clicked on bookmark again.
